# Recap

I am grateful to have completed the Google.com clone page by applying key web development techniques:

- [x] Controlled layout by using **inline** elements instead of block-level tags.  
- [x] Adjusted **margins** to make the page more visually appealing.  
- [x] Applied varied **padding** to improve readability and spacing.  
- [x] Customized **border radius**, color, and thickness for refined styling.  
- [x] Leveraged **classes** to style elements using external and internal CSS.  
- [x] Implemented `<div>` tags to divide the page into distinct sections.  
- [x] Reviewed **three methods** to center elements effectively.  
- [x] Incorporated the **Flexbox model** for responsive layout control.
